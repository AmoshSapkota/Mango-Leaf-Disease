# Mango-Leaf-Disease Classifier 
We will investigate and evaluate the classification performance of Decision Tree, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) approaches.
On doing so SVM classifier has got more accuracy
mango-leaf-disease-using-cnn-improved is the final code for CNN classifier after hyper parameter tuning.
mango-leaf-disease-using-decision-tree is the final code for decision tree classifier after hyper parameter tuning
mango-leaf-disease-using-suppert-vector-machine is the final code for SVM classifier after hyper parameter tuning
