# Mango Leaf Disease Detection

## Overview

This project investigates and evaluates the classification performance of three machine learning approaches: Decision Tree, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect different types of diseases in Mango Leaf.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of images of mango leaves affected by various diseases.
